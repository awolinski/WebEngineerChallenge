This application uses open source data from the Toronto Waste Wizard Database to create a search. The search retrieves relevant information that can be saved to a favourites list by clicking the star icon next to the item, and it can be removed from the list by again clicking the star icon. 

The application was created with the help of some boiler plate code to help install packages etc. from git@github.com:StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter.git Redux Simple Starter.
